# abap-binary-tools
This is a collection of binary tools for ABAP. Because there are no build-in binary classes I decide to develop some useful converters as well as capabilities to calculate with binary numbers.

## Converters
- [Integer to Binary](src/zcl_integer_to binary.class.abap)   
- [Binary to Integer](src/zcl_binary_to_integer.class.abap)
